# Changelog

All notable changes to AdRouter Agent are documented here.

## [0.1.0-beta.18] - 2026-08-11

### Security

- Retry installation self-revocation exactly once with the Router's bounded revoke-purpose DPoP
  nonce, preserving body, token, key, version, redirect, and local-cleanup bindings. Beta.17 could
  clear its encrypted local credential after sign-out but could not confirm hosted revocation when
  the Router issued the required nonce challenge.

## [0.1.0-beta.17] - 2026-08-11

### Security

- Bound workspace reads, listings, regular-file replacements, deletes, dependency-manifest writes,
  and review operations to descriptor-based native handles so a project cannot substitute a
  symlink between validation and use.
- Made protected-path matching case-insensitive on macOS and Windows and resolved silent Git
  inspection only from fixed trusted system locations, preventing project-controlled executable
  shadowing.
- Added bounded Router response parsing, NDJSON line/stream limits, idle timeouts, and packaged
  broker verification for macOS, Linux, and Windows candidates.

## [0.1.0-beta.16] - 2026-08-10

### Fixed

- Matched inline sponsor-banner geometry to thinking and tool-call blocks at desktop widths.
- Kept a followed timeline anchored to the newest streamed or resized content while preserving a
  user's deliberate upward scroll.
- Replaced serialized edit approvals with bounded multiline operation, file, before, and after
  previews for create, modify, and delete requests; malformed legacy previews now fail closed with
  concise guidance instead of exposing unreadable JSON.

## [0.1.0-beta.15] - 2026-08-10

### Security

- Updated the production DOMPurify override to 3.4.13 and the build-time Nano ID override to
  3.3.18 so the immutable candidate is not affected by GHSA-55q2-fjhq-7xh7 through Monaco Editor
  or GHSA-2v37-7h3g-55p8 through Vite/PostCSS.

## [0.1.0-beta.14] - 2026-08-10

### Fixed

- Accepted the Router's signed catalog v2 envelope, including input-modality and tool-calling
  capability fields, so an approved installation no longer fails during its signed profile check.
- Persisted a valid approved installation even when model discovery is temporarily unavailable,
  using the bundled compatible catalog until automatic refresh succeeds.
- Kept incompatible catalogs as an update-required state instead of discarding the approved key,
  and exposed only models that currently pass coding tool-call qualification.

## [0.1.0-beta.13] - 2026-08-07

### Added

- Added exact Router model-catalog validation, token-aware sponsor-free context compaction, safe
  checkpoints, and durable session fork/search/redacted import/export workflows.
- Added immutable approved structured file, dependency, script, network, and Git operations plus a
  capacity-bounded workspace/Git lease scheduler and opt-in bounded child delegation.
- Added exact-digest declarative bundles and GUI-paired Ed25519 automation over owner-only local IPC,
  with dependency-free launcher `pair` and `rpc` commands.
- Added Agent-native task presets with immutable per-task instructions/capability snapshots, plus
  exact-digest project Markdown skills and explicitly inserted prompt templates.
- Added backward-readable RFC 8785/Ed25519 release-manifest schema 4, fixed-origin signed update
  checks, healthy-start rollback state, and protected macOS/Windows signing hooks.

### Security

- Every mutation and Git write remains bound to an expiring one-use operation and a fresh exact
  approval; scheduler concurrency, delegation, automation, network, outputs, and queues are bounded.
- Task policy is checked before approval consumption and cannot be widened by later project/preset
  edits; changed, removed, or revoked project guidance fails closed without stale fallback.
- The candidate remains credential-free: macOS is ad-hoc signed, Linux and Windows are unsigned,
  and every artifact is pinned by canonical URL, layout, architecture, and SHA-256 in a schema-3
  launcher manifest.
- Patched the production Pi dependency path to `brace-expansion@5.0.9` and `undici@8.9.0`, and
  pinned `fast-uri@3.1.5`; the production npm audit reports no vulnerabilities.
- Packaged only the target-architecture native sandbox helper outside ASAR and bound the runtime to
  its exact Resources path so Linux and Windows continue to fail closed instead of losing OS
  sandbox enforcement after Vite bundling.
- Signed update application remains disabled until a future protected schema-4 release is
  provisioned and accepted.

### Changed

- Restored an explicit beta-only credential-free release path while retaining schema-4 verification
  and rollback code for a future signed release.
- Candidate publication leaves npm `beta` and `latest` unchanged until downloaded beta.13 artifacts
  pass primary macOS and physical Windows 11 x64 acceptance.

### Known limitations

- This beta is not Developer ID signed, notarized, or Authenticode signed; updates remain manual.
- Physical Windows 11 x64 acceptance is intentionally deferred until the exact npm/GitHub candidate
  is installed on the designated Windows laptop.

## [0.1.0-beta.12] - 2026-08-01

### Added

- Added sign-in-first Desktop Agent enrollment: the browser authenticates first, and the Agent
  creates its installation key and approval request only after the user selects **Continue**.
- Added main-process controls to reopen or copy the sign-in/approval link and signed best-effort
  cancellation for abandoned or failed authorizations.

### Changed

- Existing installations remain active while a replacement is pending and are replaced only after
  the candidate installation completes signed profile validation.
- Pending approvals resume after restart, while the pre-Continue browser handoff remains memory-only.
- The hosted AdRouter WebUI now distinguishes Desktop Agent handoffs and completion guidance from
  AdRouterCLI without changing the shared backend protocol.

### Security

- Kept browser handoff identifiers, direct enrollment URLs, key generation, clipboard access, and
  browser launching out of the sandboxed renderer.
- Sanitized enrollment and network failures so raw platform or server errors are not exposed to the
  renderer.

## [0.1.0-beta.11] - 2026-07-29

### Security

- Pinned transitive build dependencies to `tar@7.5.22` and `tmp@0.2.7`, removing the open
  path-traversal, archive-write, denial-of-service, and critical decompression advisory roots.
- Replaced packaged staging-origin substring matching with parsed exact JavaScript literal checks
  in both main and renderer bundles, backed by fresh-install packaged acceptance.
- Added a fail-closed build audit that rejects every new high or critical advisory while narrowly
  bounding the known dev-only Electron Forge `brace-expansion` advisory.

### Changed

- CI and immutable release-tag validation now run both production and build-tool dependency audits.
- Beta.11 publishes under npm `candidate` first and cannot move `beta` or `latest` until exact
  acceptance includes a physical Windows 11 x64 cohort.

## [0.1.0-beta.10] - 2026-07-28

### Added

- Added a persisted light/dark theme with an accessible bottom-left switch and smooth whole-app
  theme transitions that respect reduced-motion preferences.

### Changed

- Refined the chat composer, sponsor banners, and approval surfaces into opaque flat cards, with
  improved dark-mode colors, clearer approval actions, and extra end-of-thread clearance for the
  post-stream banner.
- Made drawers, composer panels, suggestions, and theme motion slower and smoother across the app.
- Made model/custom-instruction settings collapsible and improved settings-section spacing.
- Simplified the Changes drawer to show only changed lines in a familiar before/after diff view.

### Fixed

- Bottom sponsor banners now wait until model streaming finishes, and internal final-evidence
  payloads no longer appear in the chat transcript.
- Dark mode now keeps the main composer, settings sign-out action, and permission panel fully
  opaque with readable contrast.

## [0.1.0-beta.9] - 2026-07-28

### Fixed

- Changes now render from the bundled Monaco editor under the desktop app's strict offline content
  security policy instead of remaining indefinitely on a loading state.
- Switching projects or starting a new chat now clears the previous thread and diff state
  immediately, preventing stale workspace content from remaining visible.

### Changed

- Packaged Electron acceptance now verifies a rendered Monaco diff and an empty transcript after
  starting a new chat, protecting both functional fixes at the release boundary.

## [0.1.0-beta.8] - 2026-07-27

### Added

- User-approved Desktop installations with OS-encrypted Ed25519 keys, resumable WebUI approval,
  rotating refresh credentials, signed profile/turn requests, and privileged revocation.
- Redacted installation diagnostics, exact-candidate authentication acceptance validation, and a
  packaged manual smoke mode that never accepts bearer credentials.

### Changed

- Official hosted origins now use installation-bound authentication. Explicit local and custom
  routers retain an isolated advanced bearer-token path.
- Release and promotion workflows are credential-free; manual exact-artifact cohorts provide hosted
  authentication evidence before channel promotion.

### Security

- Private keys, refresh credentials, device codes, access tokens, nonces, and proofs remain outside
  renderer IPC, local journals, model/tool context, workflow secrets, and diagnostic output.
- The utility process can request protected headers only for bounded exact-byte profile and agent
  turn requests through a dedicated allowlisted main-process broker.

## [0.1.0-beta.7] - 2026-07-26

### Added

- Device-local sign out clears only the OS-encrypted AdRouter API credential and returns to
  prefilled onboarding so users can replace a rotated key without losing projects, chats, or
  preferences.
- Canonical jellyfish branding and Lucide controls now carry through the first-run experience,
  workspace toolbar, chat empty state, native app bundle, executable, and Linux window identity.

### Changed

- The desktop chat and tiered sponsor surfaces now more closely follow the shared WebUI ivory/blue
  design while retaining desktop project, approval, and review controls.
- History slides in and out from the left; Changes and Settings slide in and out from the right,
  with reduced-motion behavior preserved.

### Security

- Sign out remains a privileged main-process operation, is rejected while an agent task is active,
  and never exposes credential plaintext to the renderer.

## [0.1.0-beta.6] - 2026-07-26

### Fixed

- The Windows launcher now accepts Electron Forge's verified flat portable ZIP
  layout while continuing to reject absolute paths, drive-qualified paths,
  traversal, ambiguous path segments, and escaping symbolic links.
- Cross-platform promotion smokes no longer cancel healthy operating-system
  jobs when another matrix member fails, preserving complete deployment
  evidence before public distribution tags can move.

## [0.1.0-beta.5] - 2026-07-26

### Fixed

- The Windows launcher now binds ZIP inspection and extraction paths through
  explicit PowerShell parameters, so a verified portable archive is listed and
  expanded correctly on Windows 11.
- Windows npm smoke tests invoke the native `.cmd` launcher shim instead of the
  MSYS shell shim, preventing runner drive-letter translation from corrupting
  the installed package path.

## [0.1.0-beta.4] - 2026-07-26

### Added

- Portable Ubuntu 24.04 x64 and Windows 11 x64 desktop distributions alongside
  the existing universal macOS application.
- Platform-specific sandbox readiness diagnostics, secure credential-store
  checks, launcher installation paths, and native CI acceptance jobs.
- The live `https://api-staging.adrouter.co` origin as the default for fresh
  desktop installations and the protected release canary.

### Security

- Linux refuses weak `basic_text` credential storage, Windows uses DPAPI, and
  command tools remain unavailable until the platform sandbox is ready.
- Release manifests now select an exact OS/CPU artifact and verify its checksum,
  archive layout, executable, and target-specific integrity policy.

### Fixed

- The macOS distribution verifier now selects only the macOS universal ZIP when
  Linux and Windows artifacts are present in the same Forge output tree.

### Known limitations

- Linux and Windows portable beta artifacts are unsigned.
- Updates remain manual and only one agent run can be active at a time.

## [0.1.0-beta.3] - 2026-07-26

### Fixed

- The npm installer now accepts the standard relative framework symlinks inside
  an Electron macOS bundle while rejecting absolute, ambiguous, or escaping
  symlink targets before and after extraction.
- Anonymous registry propagation waits are long enough for a newly published
  candidate to become visible before macOS install smoke tests begin.

## [0.1.0-beta.2] - 2026-07-26

### Added

- First public-beta distribution of the universal macOS desktop application.
- Credential-free ad-hoc-signed universal ZIP delivery through GitHub Releases.
- Dependency-free npm launcher installation into `~/Applications` with
  checksum, archive, bundle identity, architecture, and integrity validation.
- Dependency-free `@adrouter/agent` npm installer and launcher with embedded
  release metadata, bounded downloads, checksum validation, safe extraction,
  signing verification, and Gatekeeper assessment.
- Immutable-tag release, protected staging/signing/publishing environments,
  SBOMs, artifact manifests, and GitHub artifact attestations.

### Security

- Production dependency resolutions override `brace-expansion` to `5.0.8` and
  `protobufjs` to `7.6.5`; reviewed Pi agent package versions remain unchanged.
- npm accepts no URL/checksum environment overrides and rejects unsupported
  platforms before downloading.

### Fixed

- Hosted AdRouter requests now leave `runtime_mode` unset when automatic routing
  is selected, preserving the server default and avoiding a rejected explicit
  `auto` value.

### Known limitations

- macOS only, with one active agent run at a time.
- Updates are downloaded and installed manually.
- A reachable AdRouter server and valid bearer token are required.
